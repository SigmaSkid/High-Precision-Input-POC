# High Precision Input POC

The point of this proof of concept is to prove  
just how simple it is to copy what overwatch's high precision mouse input does  
in the context of games from valve's counter strike franchise.  
And the latest game in the series in particular. (cs2)  

# Why?

Because I'm deeply disappointed with valve, and the direction of cs2.  
Instead of trying to compete with blizzards 4 year old solution,
cs2 team decided to tie the inputs to the fps...   
Which I find extremely stupid, considering how simple  
it would be to implement this system in place of subtick.  
All of the needed interpolation stuff is already included in the subtick system.  

# Can I implement this in my game?

Sure. That's precisely why I've made this open source.  
We need more games that have decent input systems.  
Just remember that this is just a proof of concept,  
and that an actual implementation will take  
quite a lot more code. This is not a copy paste type of solution.  
Just abide by the license.  
I'm happy if you have found this POC to be either educational or helpful

# Compiling
Just use Visual studio 2022.  
The .sln file is included.
