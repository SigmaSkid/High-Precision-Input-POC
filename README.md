# High Precision Input POC

The point of this proof of concept is to prove  
just how simple it is to copy what overwatch's high precision mouse input does  
in the context of games from valve's counter strike series.  

# Why?

Because I'm deeply disappointed with valve, and the direction of cs2.  
Instead of mimicking/replicating/copying the best solution for the issue at hand,  
cs2 ties input to the fps.  
Which I find extremely stupid, when the game runs much slower than it did before the cs2 update.  
(Hey, it's an update right? I mean, the cs:go reviews still count as cs2 reviews... so it's the same game...)
